app/models/tweet.rb:
after_create_commit { broadcast_prepend_to "tweets" }
# "tweets" needs to refer to a frame on the page with the same name

views/tweets/index/html.erb - wrap tweets in:
<%= turbo_frame_tag 'tweets' do %>

also add - tells ActionCable channel to listen to that stream:
<%= turbo_stream_from "tweets" %>

---

app/models/tweet/rb - this doesn't work because we need to wrap each tweet in a frame:
after_update_commit { broadcast_replace_to "tweets" }
after_destroy_commit { broadcast_remove_to "tweets" }
